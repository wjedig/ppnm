NOTE:

The general structure I have used in the homeworks (I have called them assignments) is to 
have files that are capitalised (e.g. Out.txt) to represent files that are intended for viewing.

Files with lower cases (e.g. out.b.data) are often data filed that are used for plotting.

Likewise, if an output file is specific to a part of the question, it will be called Out.A.txt, Out.B.txt, etc.
If I felt it made more sense to combine the outputs into a single file, it will simply be called Out.txt
